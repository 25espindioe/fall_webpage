  <h1>History of Christmas</h1>  
  <h3>Earliest Mentions</h3>
<p>Christmas came from the second century, where christians celebrated the holiday in order to remember the birth of jesus christ, even though they didn't agree on a set date.
  The earliest time christmas was marked on the 25th of december is in a roman calendar, known as the chronograph of 354.</p>

  <h3>Choice of Date</h3>
  <p>Many factors allowed christmas to be marked on the 25th. Winter solstice was on that day in the Roman Empire, and most christans lived in Rome.
   Rome selibrated a Roman festival called Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (birthday of Sol Invictus, the 'invincible sun' and the Christians linked jesus christ to that event, letting christmas be on December 25th.) </p>
